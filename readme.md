**Data Preparation Program**

1. We are doing a short term load forecasting (STLF).

2. This program is designed to extract the datasets from a csv file.
The csv file is generated from dumping the sql table.

3. The datasets are separated into two sets, weekend and weekdays.

**Current Development**

1. Reconstruct the program, so the can be treat as a general data preparation program for STLF. Since now, the program only works with the provided csv file.
